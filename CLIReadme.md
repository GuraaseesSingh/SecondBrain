Just a small tool idea to build as hackathon
Project Goals
Build a CLI tool to detect hardcoded secrets

Integrate with Git hooks to block unsafe commits

Provide CI/CD integration for GitHub Actions

Position the tool as a real-world DevOps/SRE utility

Use the project to learn, build your portfolio, and land a job

📆 Project Phases & Time Estimates
Phase 1: Build the CLI Tool – ⏱️ 4–6 hours
Scan files or git diffs for API keys using regex and entropy

Support for OpenAI, AWS, Stripe, and custom secret patterns

Show results with clear pass/fail/warn statuses

Ignore irrelevant files (e.g., .env, node_modules, etc.)

Phase 2: Git Hook Integration – ⏱️ 2–4 hours
Install a pre-commit or pre-push hook automatically

Block commits that include hardcoded secrets

Output helpful guidance for fixing issues (e.g., use .env)

Phase 3: CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions) – ⏱️ 3–5 hours
Build a GitHub Action YAML that runs your scanner

Fail the pull request check if secrets are detected

(Optional) Post a comment in the PR with warnings

Phase 4: Polish & Presentation – ⏱️ 4–6 hours
Write a polished README.md with install, usage, and examples

Add screenshots or terminal GIFs showing the tool in action

Create a sample repo that "leaks" a key and shows your tool catching it

Write a Dev.to or Medium blog post walking through the tool

Phase 5: Resume, LinkedIn, and Sharing – ⏱️ 2–3 hours
Add to your résumé with a strong bullet point

Share a post on LinkedIn with screenshots or the blog

Post in DevOps/security communities (Reddit, Discord, HN, etc.)

🛠️ Skills You'll Learn
Git internals and pre-commit hooks

Regex for token detection

CLI development (Python / Node.js / Go)

GitHub Actions and CI pipeline setup

Static analysis and secret entropy checks

Developer tooling best practices

📄 Resume Bullet Example
“Built a CLI + CI-integrated tool to detect and block hardcoded API keys (OpenAI, AWS, Stripe) before commit or deployment. Implemented Git hooks, GitHub Action integration, and entropy-based static analysis to improve DevSecOps hygiene across development workflows.”

✅ Summary
This project gives you practical, job-ready DevOps experience with real-world security relevance. It shows you know how to:

Think like an SRE or DevSecOps engineer

Automate guardrails to protect developers

Integrate tools directly into developer workflows

By completing and sharing it, you can:

Land job interviews

Build your portfolio

Possibly attract freelance, open-source, or even acquisition interest













=================================WEB3 SOlana way




Rather than scanning secrets on-chain (bad idea: secrets shouldn't go on-chain), you can:

Record security violations to Solana

Log detected leaks or violations immutably on Solana

Used for audit trails / compliance (e.g., proving secrets were never leaked in production)

Each commit or scan result becomes a signed transaction

Reward secure developers via token incentives

Give devs a badge (NFT) or tokens if they follow best practices

Use Solana smart contracts to mint tokens after scans pass

Use Solana as a tamper-proof ledger

Every time your tool scans and finds nothing, it writes a "secure commit" hash to Solana

Companies can use this as part of their security audit logs

🧠 Updated Project Plan (with Solana Integration)
🔁 New Phase 6: Solana Blockchain Extension – ⏱️ 6–10 hours
Option A: Immutable Audit Logging

Log commit SHA + scan result to Solana

Use a simple on-chain Solana program (smart contract) to accept signed results

Each entry includes:

Repo name

Commit hash

Timestamp

Scan status (passed/failed)

Option B: Token/NFT Reward System

Mint an NFT badge to developers whose repos pass all secret scans

Smart contract on Solana mints reward (NFT or token) on success

Could be linked to a GitHub Action or CLI command

Tools/Libraries:

Use solana-py or Anchor (Rust)

Connect via CLI using Solana wallet keypair

Write a basic Solana smart contract (Rust) or use existing ones

🧠 You learn:

Web3 & smart contract fundamentals

Solana transaction signing and security

Integrating blockchain with DevOps workflows

🧠 How to Present It (Big Flex Alert 🚨)
“Extended my DevSecOps scanner with on-chain audit logging using the Solana blockchain, ensuring commit security history is tamper-proof and auditable. Integrated smart contracts to reward developers who follow secret-handling best practices with token/NFT incentives.”

🚀 Why This Is Killer for Job Hunting
Most candidates stop at CLI tools.

You're combining DevOps + Security + Blockchain.

Recruiters & startups love hybrid skillsets (esp. if they’re into Web3 or fintech).

Could attract interest from Web3 security firms or DAOs.

{I never used a condom.
I always hesitated to buy one for myself.

So here we go —

I built one... for developers. 🍌

The first CLI that protects your code from leaking secrets — OpenAI keys, AWS tokens, Stripe creds — before you even commit.

🔒 Unisex. Frictionless. Always ready.
Use it whenever you're building something.

Don't hesitate. Stay safe.
